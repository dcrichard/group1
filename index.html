                        <h3>About me</h3>
                        <p>Born and raised in Reno, NV most of my life. Lived in Modesto, California with my family but we retreated back to Reno not long after. First generation college student with a big interest in computer science. Not sure what exactly I want to do with it or what specifically I want to study in computer science but definitely something within that major. Started at Lemmon valley elementary, on to O'brien middle, then North Valleys high school. Only sports I ever played were soccer and football.</p>
                        <h3>Occupation</h3>
                        <p>Currently a college student with a full time wear house job. I am a NASM certified personal trainer as well and do that on the side until I can find a gym I am comfortable working for with the right environment.</p>
                        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                        <p>My only hobbies right now I would say are homework and a amateur bodybuilding. Also enjoy spending time with friends and family.</p>
                        <h3>Goals</h3>
                        <p>I hope to find the right field of computer science that I want to build a career in and work for a big company after I graduate college.</p>
                        <h3>Project Subject</h3>
                        <p>I will be digging into the trend regarding the usage of ad blockers and their exponential growth.</p>

                        <h3>About me</h3>
                        <p>Richard Morse was born and raised in Reno, NV. I am a 3d generation with my children continuing the extension of the Morse family.  I am 46 and continuing my education at Truckee Meadows Community College.  My daughter, 23 years of age has graduated as a Pharmacy Technician.  My son, 18 years of age has just begun University of Nevada Reno studying Electrical Engineering.  As a young chap I went to Veterans Memorial Elementary, Vaughn Middle School, and then Wooster High.  My favorite sport at the time was basketball where I lettered in as a guard.  I continued with sports for a much longer time, and even played semi pro hockey.  Recently all the sports I have played have caught up to me and am now unable to do to injuries.  I am hoping to take advantage of my mind and continue to get my degree in computers, be it front end development or even a lower level programmer in C++ / Rust.  I look forward to learning as much as I can in this class and all future classes related to coding.</p>
                        <h3>Occupation</h3>
                        <p>I currently work for Charter Communications (rebranding to Spectrum) as a test engineer.  I work with the front end development team testing HTML / CSS / Javascript and more. </p>
                        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                        <p>My hobbies are learning and programming and keeping my son's head on straight.</p>
                        <h3>Goals</h3>
                        <p>I would like to open my own business in the future and code remotely for any employer willing to pay me to work at home.  I hope to get my business started in the next 3 years.  </p>
                        <h3>Project Subject</h3>
                        <p>I will introducing and explaining Progressive Web Applications for this project.</p>

                        <h3>About me</h3>
                        <p>Damien is originally from Mt. Desert Island, Maine; but, he grew up on the Central Oregon coast. In his early years he traveled across the United States extensively. By the age of 9 he had attended school in four different states (including Maine, Hawaii, Oregon, and Florida), settling in Oregon where he remained until he graduated from high school in 1993.</p><br />
                        <p>After graduating from high school he joined the US Army as a Heavy Wheel Vehicle Mechanic, completing both his Basic and Advanced training at Ft. Jackson, South Carolina. He spent three years in the military, each year at a different duty station. His first year was spent at Ft. Knox, Kentucky, his second year was spent near Soul, Korea, and his final year was spent at Ft. Stewart, Georgia, honorably completing his service obligation at the rank of Specialist. Damien thoroughly enjoyed his time serving the country and would do it over again if given the same choices.</p>
                        <h3>Family</h3>
                        <p>Damien is happily married to his wife Kelly, and has 5 children.  As to be expected, their houshold is very active, although; with the two oldest children both now serving in the military itâ€™s not as busy around the house as it has been in the past. The children that are still in the house range from 16 years old down to 5 years old, and they are all active in sports and other extracurricular activities, so there never seems to be a dull moment or lack of functions to attend.</p>
                        <h3>Occupation</h3>
                        <p>After completing his tour in the military, he began working in the gaming industry, working two years at a casino on the Oregon coast. In 1998 he hired on with a gaming vendor based out of Lake Tahoe, and moved to Carson City, Nevada. In 2000 he moved to Reno, Nevada, where he has been living ever since. Today Damien works as a Senior Systems Software QA Manager for a global gaming company that designs, manufacturers, distributes, and operates gaming devices and computerized monitoring, accounting, and player-tracking systems for the gaming/lottery industries.</p>
                        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                        <p>When Damien is not at work or taking classes he enjoys spending time with his family, fishing, watching football, and entertaining friends <i>(not necessarily in that order)</i>.</p>
                        <h3>Goals</h3>
                        <p>Throughout Damien's life he has taken a considerable number of college courses, including web and application development; however, he has never earned a degree. His short term goal is to complete his Associates of Applied Science in Computer Information Technology with a Computer Programming Emphasis, then move forward towards a four year degree in the same area.</p>
                        <h3>Project Subject</h3>
                        <p>For this project, Damien will be sharing his findings as they relate to <a href="damien.html">Responsive Web Design</a>.</p>
