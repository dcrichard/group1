                        <h2 id="contentstart">Introduction and Support</h2>
                        <h3>What is this trend?</h3>

                        <p> Ad blocking, the next biggest little thing. If you're a frequent user of the internet whether its on your phone or on your computer, you know that ads are everywhere.
                           they infultrate almost all websites you visit and many of the apps that we use, typically the free ones. Although these ads are supposed to be "helpful" by trying
                           to only show things that might be of interest to you and tailored for you through malware, they are still annoying and not visually pleasing to the everyday user. Studies are showing that
                          an ad blocking trend has begun dating back to January of 2013 and located mostly in the Eastern part of the world. Users in the East have begun to use software that is made to
                          block ads from appearing anywhere on your desktop or mobile device. The main thing driving people towards using these ad blockers is ad-frustration.
                          Ads being annoying pop-ups, phishing scams, and misdirected links are some of the main reasons that created this trend for security and experience purposes. </p>
                        <h3>Is this trend supported by current technology?</h3>
                        <p> Currently most of the ad blocking is being done on mobile devices but the trend is steadely growing
                        on desktops as well. The ad blocking trend is not seen in North America and Europe as much as it is in Asia and the East but it is there also and continues to grow. This is a huge threat to
                        companies who do their advertisng this way which is many, money losses due to this is said to be 27 billion by 2020. Current technology does support this trend with fact that both google and apple
                        have annouced new ad-blocking capabilities on their updated browsers settings (Google Chrome and Safari). The only things going agaisnt this is of course the companies paying for this advertising.
                        Different ways of combatting it have been seen through out different websites ones example is the website you visit may ask you to disable your browsers ad-blocker or to add this site to the exceptions list.
                        This obvisouly isnt an ideal solution so efforts to implement more satisfying and desirable ads is what it looks like these ad giants will have to do. </p>
